First time setup:
- Install:
  - Docker (docker compose)
  - Tailscale
  - SSH (usually comes with OS)

Tailscale:
- Always use auth key
- Disable auth key expiry
- Set as exit node
- Enable local network access (as exit node)
- Setup subnet router pointing towards raspberry pi
- Set tailscale DNS to point to raspberrypi (& override default)

Pi-Hole:
- DNS Server (DNS sinkhole / adblocker)
- Set DHCP rule to give pi-hole machine's MAC address a fixed local IP
- Set router lan settings (proxy DNS / static DNS point to pihole)
- Set broadband (static DNS point to pihole) -> https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/q9ngmw/psa_to_anyone_with_centurylink_a_zyxel_modem/
- Admin portal runs on :3000
- Flush DNS cache -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-flush-dns-on-mac-macos-clear-dns-cache/#version
- Create DNS domain entry pointing to raspberrypi - should be seen on wifi, on tailscale & on tailscale w/ exit node

VaultWarden:
- Password manager
- Requires Caddy (reverse proxy) so we can point to https://vault.hermetic.dev with a valid SSL cert
- Requires valid SSL cert, and if we want to connect to bitwarden apps it needs to be validated by a trusted CA
- Requires valid domain to be owned
- https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Using-Docker-Compose

Caddy:
- Reverse proxy
- Requires DNS mapping (CNAME) pointing domain/subdomain to raspberry pi (PiHole), this lets Caddy route the request to the correct docker container based on the domain
- Uses Let's Encrypt to sign certs (Caddy performs DNS challenge)
- https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Running-a-private-vaultwarden-instance-with-Let%27s-Encrypt-certs
- Connects to Porkbun (DNS provider) to modify TXT records on domain for ACME challenge
- https://github.com/caddy-dns/porkbun
- https://github.com/serfriz/caddy-custom-builds
- https://github.com/serfriz/caddy-custom-builds/tree/main/caddy-porkbun-dockerproxy (Docker proxy for porkbun) 

Portainer:
- Container manager / viewer
- Requires valid SSL certificate (so is reverse proxied by Caddy similarly to Vaultwarden)
- https://docs.portainer.io/

On Startup: (startup.sh)
- Disable wifi power saving mode -> https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=339699
